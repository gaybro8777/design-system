        <li>Selection is subject to restrictions resulting from Department of Defense referral system for displaced employees.</li>
        <li>If you have retired from federal service and you are interested in employment as a reemployed annuitant, see the information in the <a href="http://www.armycivilianservice.com/JOA/retiree.pdf">Reemployed Annuitant </a>information sheet.</li>
        <li>It is the policy of the government not to deny employment simply because an individual has been unemployed or has had financial difficulties that have arisen through no fault of the individual.  Information about an individual's employment experience will be used only to determine the person's qualifications and to assess his or her relative level of knowledge, skills and abilities. Although an individual's personal conduct may be relevant in any employment decision, including conduct during periods of unemployment or evidence of dishonesty in handling financial matters, financial difficulty that has arisen through no fault of the individual will generally not itself be the basis of an unfavorable suitability or fitness determination. Please click <a href="https://help.usajobs.gov/index.php/Legal_and_Regulatory_Guidance">here</a> for more information regarding financial suitability.</li>
