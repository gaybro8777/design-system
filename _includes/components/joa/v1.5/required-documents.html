    <p>The documents you are required to submit vary based on the authority you are using to apply (i.e., applying as a veteran, applying as a current permanent Federal employee, applying as a reinstatement, etc). Please review the following links to see which documents you need to provide to prove your eligibility to apply:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.armycivilianservice.com/JOA/CK1.pdf">Applicant Merit Checklist</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.armycivilianservice.com/JOA/Proof.pdf">Proof of Eligibility</a>. </p>
    <p>As described above, your complete application includes your resume, your responses to the online questionnaire, and documents which prove&nbsp;your eligibility to apply.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>If you fail to provide these documents, you will be marked as having an incomplete application package and you will not be considered any further.</b></p>

    <p><strong>Your resume</strong>: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your resume may be submitted in any format. </li>
      <li>If you submit more than one copy of your resume, only the most recent version will be reviewed. The latest timestamp will be used to determine which version of your resume is "most recent." It is your responsibility to check the status and timestamp of all documents you submit as part of your application. </li>
      <li>If your resume includes a photograph or other inappropriate material or content, it will not be used to make eligibility and qualification determinations and you&nbsp;may not be considered for this vacancy. </li>
      <li>For qualifications determinations your resume must contain hours worked per week and the dates of employment (i.e., HRS per week and month/year to month/year or month/year to present). If your resume does not contain this information, your application will be marked as&nbsp;incomplete and you will not receive consideration for this position.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>If you are&nbsp;relying on your education to meet qualification requirements</strong>: You <strong>MUST</strong> submit a copy of your transcript if you want to substitute your education for experience. If you claim qualifications based on education, and do not submit a transcript, your education will not be used in making a qualification determination and you may be found "not qualified."&nbsp; See: <a href="http://www.armycivilianservice.com/JOA/Transcripts.pdf">Transcripts and Licenses</a></p>
