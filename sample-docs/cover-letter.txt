Re: Customer Service Representative Opening (Ref. ID: CS300-Denver) Dear Ms. West:

￼￼￼I was excited to see your opening for a customer service rep, and I hope to be ￼invited for an interview.

￼My background includes serving as a customer service associate within both call-￼center and retail environments. Most recently, I worked on the customer service ￼desk for Discount-Mart, where my responsibilities included handling customer ￼merchandise returns, issuing refunds/store credits, flagging damaged merchandise ￼for shipment back to vendors and providing back-up cashiering during busy periods.

￼Previously, I worked within two high-volume customer-support call centers for a ￼major telecommunications carrier and a satellite television services provider. In ￼these positions, I demonstrated the ability to resolve a variety of issues and ￼complaints (such as billing disputes, service interruptions or cutoffs, repair technician ￼delays/no-shows and equipment malfunctions). I consistently met my call-volume ￼goals, handling an average of 56 to 60 calls per day.

￼In addition to this experience, I gained considerable customer service skills during ￼my part-time employment as a waitress and restaurant hostess while in high school.

￼I also bring to the table strong computer proficiencies in MS Word, MS Excel and ￼CRM database applications and a year of college (business major). Please see the ￼accompanying resume for details of my experience and education.

￼I am confident that I can offer you the customer service, communication and ￼problem-solving skills you are seeking. Feel free to call me at 555-555-5555 (home) ￼or 555-555-5500 (cell) to arrange an interview. Thank you for your time -- I look ￼forward to learning more about this opportunity!

￼Sincerely,
Sue Ling
