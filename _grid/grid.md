          To use the grid, wrap each grid row in a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with the <code>usajobs-grid</code> class. To use a grid without padding on the right and left, use the <code>usajobs-grid-full</code> class instead.

          In order to migrate from the Bootstrap system currently in use we are temporarily relying on the breakpoints of that system. Future designs will add the U.S. Web Design Standard breakpoints. We use t-shirt sizes to track and discuss each breakpoint. At certain breakpoints the grid changes the overall number of columns giving us more finite control as the viewport expands.
